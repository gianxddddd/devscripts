## Python
devscripts is written in Python, and it's required packages are not included.

- Python is installed in Linux Distributions, if not, then install it from their [website](https://python.org) or doing `sudo apt install python3`
- pip is also installed in Linux Distributions, otherwise, install by doing `sudo apt install pip`

(Windows)   
- Python is not installed in default, so you have to install it directly from their [website](https://python.org).
- pip is also needed, visit this [tutorial](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows) to install pip.
